The main requirement for this workshop is a personal computer with a web browser and a command line shell program.  
These will allow you to follow the online materials and to login to a facility with the required software stack.

This tutorial is adapted from [https://github.com/PawseySC/sc19-containers](https://github.com/PawseySC/sc19-containers) and delivered by New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) staff.

> ## NZ RSE 2020 Workshop Attendee Instructions
>
> Please follow these instructions carefully prior to the workshop.
>
> The tutorial will be best experienced directly on NeSI's platforms. We intend to make NeSI's new (early access) JupyterHub service available to all attendees who prefer to use a browser rather than a native SSH client to access the NeSI systems (though you are welcome to use your preferred SSH client if you wish). All the required software and container images have been preloaded on the NeSI platform under the `nesi99991` project.
>
> If you do not already have a NeSI account then please apply to [create a NeSI account](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000159715-Creating-a-NeSI-Account) well ahead of the tutorial.
>
> Once you have a NeSI account you will need membership in the relevant training project. Please log in to the [My NeSI portal](https://my.nesi.org.nz/) and follow our support documentation to [ask to join an existing project](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000693896), selecting the `nesi99991` project. Note that project membership updates are not instantaneous, so please do this well ahead of the tutorial if possible.
>
> If this is a new user account then please ensure you have [set your password and 2nd factor](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000335995) and tested that your access to NeSI is working. Contact NeSI Support via either the [form here](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new) or [email](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz) if you run into any problems.
